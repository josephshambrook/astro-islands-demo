   * Hello! ðŸ‘‹
   * I've borrowed this code off of my my own website (josephshambrook.dev).
   * What it is doing, is calling a Cloudflare Worker of mine to get my
   * current top tracks from Spotify. These results usually get inundated
   * with Disney songs played for my young daughter, but it was still fun to
   * get working!
   * Anyway, I've added comments for what each part of the code is doing, so
   * have a read!
